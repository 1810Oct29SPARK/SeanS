This will be the project proposal and use cases. 

Hello Emily,
Here is my Spark Project Theme proposal:
  I would like to make a website for fans of Mega Man.
Here are my basic use cases:
  Fans can:
    View pictures
    Switch between pages dedicated to the different subseries
    Read backstories
    Listen to BGMs from the games
    Answer trivia
    Watch videos
    Submit requests for new things to be added
    Link to official sites representing the games
      (Ex: Capcom)
Aside from the seven, I can think of some other use cases.  Some of
which are:
  Member login
  Post Walkthrough or "Let's Play" videos
  Comment Section / Blog
